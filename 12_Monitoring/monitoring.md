# AWS Monitoring

## CloudWatch
It helps you collect, monitor, and analyze data from your applications, infrastructure, and services to gain insights, troubleshoot issues, and ensure optimal performance

### Pro
- Collect and monitoring application performance etc.
- Set alarms and notifications based on thresholds/utilization.
- Integrate CloudWatch with Auto Scaling to dynamically adjust the number of instances in response to changes in demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
- Monitor log analytics.
- Monitor EKS container insights.
- Automate actions by using CloudWatch Events to respond to scheduled events or time-based triggers.

## CloudTrail
CloudTrail tracks EVERY API call in AWS account by everyone.

## AWS Config
AWS Config automatically evaluates the recorded configurations against the configuration you specify.

### Pro
- It is like a software unit test, I would recommend a test-driven development in AWS configuration with the aid on AWS Config. Specify the configuration in AWS Config for example that the LoadBalancer is assigned to an SSL certificate. Then create the Load Balancer with SSL config. AWS Config will evaluate your config.
- Let you send emails if any configuration in wrong.
