# AWS Solution Architect Helper

The idea behind this documentation is to have a clear sight at all AWS services as a solution architect. There are many services in AWS which are very similar and it is not easy to keep control of it and there is always a concern to get confused during learning.

The objective is to compare similar services and give you an high level overview that you are able to remember.

Go through all folders and have fun 😝
